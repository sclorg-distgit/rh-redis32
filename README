Package %{scl_name} provides the Redis data store as a Software
Collection.  For more information about Software Collections, see
scl(1).  By installing the %{scl_name} collection, you will get
the set of packages to have a working Redis server.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'redis-cli'

Software Collections allows use of applications which are not located
in the filesystem root hierarchy but are present in an alternative
location, which is %{_scl_root} in case of the %{scl_name}
collection.

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store,
used as database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures
such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries,
bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions
and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability
via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

The %{?scl_prefix}redis package provides the redis and sentinel servers.

Redis server listens on local network soket (by default port 6379).
Sentinel server listens on local network soket (by default port 26379).

When working with %{scl_name} collection, use the "scl" utility (see
scl(1) for usage) to enable the scl environment properly.

Configuration for the %{scl_name} software collection is located under %{_sysconfdir}.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with argument --arg within %{scl_name} software collections
  environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'redis-cli'
  Run redis-cli from %{scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run interactive shell where %{scl_name} software collection is enabled.

%if 0%{?rhel} >= 7
systemctl start %{?scl_prefix}redis
%else
service %{?scl_prefix}redis start
%endif
  Starts the redis server from %{scl_name} software collection.

%if 0%{?rhel} >= 7
systemctl start %{?scl_prefix}redis-sentinel
%else
service %{?scl_prefix}redis-sentinel start
%endif
  Starts the sentinel server from %{scl_name} software collection.
